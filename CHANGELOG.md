# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - unreleased

First version: a replica of invisible_playwright 0.25.5 with pyppeteer's contract.

- `launch()` starts the same patched Firefox with the same profile, proxy,
  geography and hidden-surface handling as `InvisiblePlaywright`, and drives it
  over Juggler: no Chromium, no DevTools protocol, `navigator.webdriver` false.
- pyppeteer's public API: `Browser`, `BrowserContext`, `Page`, `Frame`,
  `ExecutionContext`, `JSHandle`, `ElementHandle`, `Keyboard`, `Mouse`,
  `Touchscreen`, `Dialog`, `ConsoleMessage`, `Request`, `Response` and the
  exceptions, with the same coroutines and events.
- Every click, hover and mouse move travels along a path drawn from the session
  seed; keys carry the session's typing rhythm; input events are trusted.
