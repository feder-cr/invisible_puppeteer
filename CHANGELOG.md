# Changelog

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-03

### Changed
- **Values a user picks are committed by Firefox itself.** `page.select` and
  `ElementHandle.uploadFile` hand the choice to the engine's native input
  commands (`Page.selectOptions`, `Page.setFileInputFiles`), which take the
  same paths as the dropdown and the file picker. The page gets `input` and
  `change` with the shape a user's pick gives, inside shadow roots too, and
  nothing when the selection did not change, where pyppeteer fires the pair
  regardless. The command this used to call, `Page.dispatchTrustedInputEvents`,
  is gone from the engine, so this needs the engine that ships the new commands
  and lands with the core pin that seals it.

### Fixed
- **A click lands where it was asked on a page with a saved zoom**, and on
  Linux behind a SOCKS proxy real sites see WebRTC working: both are fixes in
  the firefox-35 engine.

### Requires
- `invisible-core` 35.32.0, which seals the firefox-35 engine. This version
  does not run on firefox-34, and earlier versions do not run on firefox-35.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed
- **On Linux, a headless session starts on its own virtual display.** The
  display counted as ready as soon as its lockfile existed, which Xvfb writes
  before it opens its sockets, so sessions started together could land on
  each other's display and the browser failed with `cannot open display`.
  The display is also no longer reachable over TCP.

### Requires
- `invisible-core` 34.32.0, which carries the display fix. Same engine
  (firefox-34).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-25

First version: a replica of invisible_playwright 0.25.7 with pyppeteer's contract.

- `launch()` starts the same patched Firefox with the same profile, proxy,
  geography and hidden-surface handling as `InvisiblePlaywright`, and drives it
  over Juggler: no Chromium, no DevTools protocol, `navigator.webdriver` false.
- pyppeteer's public API: `Browser`, `BrowserContext`, `Page`, `Frame`,
  `ExecutionContext`, `JSHandle`, `ElementHandle`, `Keyboard`, `Mouse`,
  `Touchscreen`, `Dialog`, `ConsoleMessage`, `Request`, `Response` and the
  exceptions, with the same coroutines and events.
- Every click, hover and mouse move travels along a path drawn from the session
  seed; keys carry the session's typing rhythm; input events are trusted.
